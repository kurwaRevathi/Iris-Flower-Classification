# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification

This project aims to classify iris flowers into three species — *Setosa*, *Versicolor*, and *Virginica* — using machine learning algorithms. The dataset consists of flower measurements like sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

## 📂 Dataset Information

The dataset used is the famous [Iris Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris) from UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains:

- **150 instances**
- **4 features**: 
  - Sepal Length (cm)
  - Sepal Width (cm)
  - Petal Length (cm)
  - Petal Width (cm)
- **Target Variable**: Species (`Iris-setosa`, `Iris-versicolor`, `Iris-virginica`)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 🔍 Steps Performed

1. **Data Loading** - Load the CSV file using `pandas`.
2. **Data Exploration** - Understand structure, stats, and check for missing values.
3. **Data Visualization** - Use plots to understand patterns and feature relationships.
4. **Model Building** - Train machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM).
5. **Model Evaluation** - Test accuracy and performance using metrics like confusion matrix.
6. **Prediction** - Predict species based on new inputs.

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

1. Clone this repository or download the notebook.
2. Make sure the Iris dataset CSV file is in the correct path.
3. Open the `.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook.
4. Run the cells one by one to see data exploration, visualizations, and model results.

```bash
# Install required packages if not already installed
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn notebook
```
